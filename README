This is the github release of Reddwarf server, formerly Project Darkstar.

This repository is converted from a compilation of SVN repositories:

    https://svn.java.net/svn/sgs-server~svn
    https://svn.java.net/svn/sgs-shared~svn
    https://svn.java.net/svn/sgs-java-client~svn
    https://svn.java.net/svn/sgs-c-client~svn
    https://svn.java.net/svn/sgs-build~svn
    https://svn.java.net/svn/sgs-maven-plugin~svn
    https://svn.java.net/svn/sgs-tests~svn
    https://svn.java.net/svn/darkstar-chat~svn
    https://svn.java.net/svn/darkstar-hack~svn
    https://svn.java.net/svn/darkstar-request~svn
    https://svn.java.net/svn/dtc~svn
    https://reddwarf.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/reddwarf

Everything originates from a single sunlabs SVN repository.  This repository
was later imported into the sgs-server repository at java.net, and also
seeded various spinoffs; the sgs-maven-plugin repository was added later.
Eventually, the reddwarf repository was created from a snapshot of the
sgs-server, sgs-shared, sgs-java-client, sgs-c-client, sgs-build and
sgs-maven-plugin source code.

Everything is gathered in a single repository.  The merge history, which was
missing or faulty in the SVN repositories, has been manually reconstructed
from commit comments and svnbranch information.

Each project has its own branch in the repository:

    sgs-server			(the master branch)
    sgs-shared
    sgs-java-client
    sgs-c-client
    sgs-build
    sgs-maven-plugin
    analysis
    dtc
    chat
    hack
    request
    qa				(sgs-tests)

Various developer branches with non-trivial changes have also been preserved.
